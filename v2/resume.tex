\section{Experience}

\begin{resumecols}{Thumbtack}{https://www.thumbtack.com/about}{Senior Software Engineer}{June 2018 - Present}
    Worked on the Customer Growth and Mobile Infrastructure teams as an Android engineer. I built features and ran A/B tests throughout the product on both the native Android apps and backend in Go/PHP/Python. As part of the small Mobile Infrastructure team I managed app architecture, code quality, CI/release pipelines, and developer productivity for the entire Android team. The apps were built primarily in Kotlin with heavy usage of the reactive paradigm via RxJava.
\end{resumecols}

\begin{resumecols}{Thumbtack}{https://www.thumbtack.com/about}{Software Engineer Intern}{Summer 2017}
    Rebuilt the login flow in the Thumbtack customer Android app from the ground up. I added account creation and Facebook login, modernized the UI, and ran A/B tests.

\begin{resumecols}{Imaging Systems Technology}{http://www.teamist.com}{Android Intern}{Summer 2016}
    Developed an Android tablet app to monitor and control a manufacturing process. The app received live data via Bluetooth, calculated aggregates, displayed realtime graphs, and kept logs of past runs. I focused on handling large amounts of data in an extensible way and presenting the data in ways that facilitated the team's decision making.

\begin{resumecols}{MetabolismFun}{https://github.com/dzirbel/metabolism-fun}{Full-Stack Web Engineer}{July 2013 - Jan 2015}
    Created the online educational game MetabolismFun (\href{https://github.com/dzirbel/metabolism-fun}{\underline{GitHub source}}) with Dr.\ Neocles Leontis at BGSU to teach metabolic pathways to college students in an engaging, interactive way. I was responsible for programming, design, and deployment.
